***Service Manage CLI*** is the official command line client for [Service Manager][1]. 

## Getting started

To use the Service Manager CLI you need to download and install it first:

### Approach 1: Manual installation

You're done! Now you can use the **smctl** command along with some other subcommand (*register-broker*, *list-platforms*, etc...) to interact with a Service Manager instance.
